# Postables-Payment-Channel (WIP)

# Introduction

Postables Payment Channels is a set of payment channel contract whichs can be reused across multiple different transactions, and parties. Currently payment channels are limited to two participating entities. It is still very much so a work in progress and will be improved over time to include my currently closed-source EVM bridge to enable payment channels across side-chains.
